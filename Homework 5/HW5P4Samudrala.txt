The main purpose of this article was to explain the usefulness and the rising popularity of Functional programing. The article explores some key benefits of FP, including its emphasis on immutability, its ability to reduce complexity and improve readability, and its support for parallel processing. The author notes that while FP can be challenging to learn and requires a different way of thinking, it is a valuable skill for developers to have in their toolset. He goes into an example of breaking down data from an api response and shows how a functional programming language can break down the data inside more readable code.
